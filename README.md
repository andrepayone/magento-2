# SOME CHANGE
# PAYMENT FOR YOUR MAGENTO 2-SHOP
The PAYONE payment extension for Magento 2 is massively reworked since the first version. The Github-Community was important for this development. Take a look at our last released version and send us commits or other feedback to take care for the best possible solution. Your feedback is very important to us to ensure a flawless code and rapid development.

## Important functions for Magento 2
*	Seamless integration of Magento's OnePage Checkout
*	Very wide range of functions, simple and comprehensible supported by detailed online help
*	Central configuration and management options on the Magento Admin Panel
*	Export function of the configuration in XML format to facilitate the technical support
*	Optional multi-partial capture for partial deliveries
*	Supports simplified PCI DSS conformity in accordance with SAQ A
*	Payment methods can be automatically hidden depending on the amount of the order and the credit rating of the customer

## Installation
*	Go to your installation directory of Magento 2 and perform the following commands
*	`composer require payone-gmbh/magento-2`
*	`php bin/magento setup:upgrade`
*	`php bin/magento setup:di:compile`
*	`php bin/magento cache:clean`

## Magento Version Support
We follow Magento's version lifetime according to their [Enterprise Agreement](https://magento.com/legal/terms/enterprise-agreement#support). In theory, Magento 2.0 is still supported, but not actively tested.

Support for Magento 2.1 was phased out in June 2019. From that date, we discontinued actively testing Magento 2.1.

Support for Magento 2.2 was phased out in December 2019. From that date, we discontinued actively testing Magento 2.2. Subsequently, it will be removed from our build matrix in the future.
